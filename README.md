# desmos-unlimited
This is a chrome override for the minified Desmos source code that removes the `definitions nested too deeply` error when doing huge computations.  I claim absolutely no responsibility for anything bad that happens as a result of patching this limit out!

How to install:

1. Set up a folder for and enable chrome overrides.
2. Download this repo.
3. Stick `www.desmos.com` in your overrides folder
4. Open chrome console (don't open it in Desmos directly, you'll softlock chrome)
5. Navigate to Desmos normally
6. Close the chrome console, you now have godmode!
