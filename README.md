# desmos-unlimited
Modded code for letting Desmos run completely unlimited

This is a chrome override for the minified Desmos source code that removes the `definitions nested too deeply` error when doing huge computations.  I claim absolutely no responsibility for anything bad that happens as a result of patching this limit out!

How to install:
**1.** Set up a folder for and enable chrome overrides
**2.** Download this repo
**3.** Stick the folder `www.desmos.com` in your overrides folder
**4.** Refresh the calculator and have fun!
